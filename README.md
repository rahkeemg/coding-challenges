# Coding Challenges

## Purpose:
This repo will be a collection of the different coding problems that I have completed and the solutions generated to solve those problems. 


You can click on the folders and files to see the content for each respective coding challenge.


## Intent & Goals of Project:


### _Intent:_ 


The intent of this project is **not** to provide an answer sheet for coding problems, but to improve and sharpen my own skillset. Below are some of the direct intents of this project, and hopefully this maybe of help, or inspiration, to others seeking the same:


### _Goals:_


- Get better at programming and thinking logically through coding problems
- Improve skills in Python and other programming languages that I am using, or will pick up in the future
- Get better at using Markdown, Git, and Github as well as any additional software that may help in projects observed.
- Improve technical writting and ability to explain coding methodology, clear and concisely to a large majority of people
