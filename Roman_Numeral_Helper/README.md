This project was created to house my solution to the following code challenges on CodeWars:

[Roman Numeral Helper](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b66044bce5799a7f000003)
[Roman Numeral Encoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b62bf6a9c58071c600001b)

With this said, there is not a check to verify that a Roman numeral string input is in a proper from vs one that is erroneous.
