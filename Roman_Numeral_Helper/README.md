# About 

This project was created to house my solution to the following code challenges on CodeWars:

[Roman Numeral Helper](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b66044bce5799a7f000003)<br>
[Roman Numeral Encoder](https://www.codewars.com/kata/51b62bf6a9c58071c600001b)

With this said, there is not a check to verify that a Roman numeral string input is in a proper from vs one that is erroneous.  

## Files

There are 4 Python files in this folder.  

* [main.py](./main.py)<br>
* [RomanNumerals.py](./RomanNumerals.py)<br>
* [RomanNumerals_static.py](./RomanNumerals_static.py)<br>
* [RomanNumeralEncoder.py](./RomanNumeralEncoder.py)<br>

The _RomanNumeral_ files are very similar.  The main file is _RomanNumerals_ and the others are refactored versions of this file.  The _static_ file was created to complete the coding challenge.  The _encoder_ file was in response to another challenge on code wars that utilized part of the functionality within the _RomanNumeral_ file. Since these were so similar, it did not seem like a good idea to create another folder dedicated to that challenge, but to just include it wihtin this file.
